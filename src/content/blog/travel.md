<p>I was lucky to live in LONDON, the hotspot on the planet. There are six airports (Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Luton, City Airport and South End on the Sea) and you can travel to almost every destination in the world. How great is it to travel? To meet new people, see new places, experience different cultures, live life the way life is lived somewhere else. Plenty of good things are associated with travel. I hope to inspire other people to plunge and travel the world.</p>
