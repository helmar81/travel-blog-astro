**Arrived in Mumbai January 15th. 2023**

My first trip to India was an experience I will never forget. From the moment I stepped off the plane, I was mesmerized by the vibrant colors, delicious smells, and bustling energy of the city.

After a long journey, I finally arrived in Mumbai early in the morning on January 15th, 2023. As I made my way through immigration, I was struck by the sheer number of people queuing up to enter the country. Despite the long wait, I was excited to finally be in India and couldn't wait to start exploring.

After clearing immigration, I took a taxi to a hostel near the airport. The driver changed me 50 Euro, which was my first experience with Indian rupees. I was a little surprised by the conversion rate, but I was too excited to be in India to let it dampen my spirits.

I spent the next few days exploring Mumbai and soaking up the culture. I visited the Gateway of India, walked along the famous Marine Drive, and even took a boat ride to the Elephanta Caves. Everywhere I went, I was struck by the kindness of the people and the richness of the culture.

Despite the traffic and pollution, I fell in love with India and all its contrasts. The trip was a mix of emotions, from the extreme poverty to the luxurious palaces, from the holy cows on the street to the colorful markets and the beautiful temples. I was also surprised by the delicious food, I had the best curry of my life.

I knew that my first trip to India would not be my last and I am already planning my next trip. I want to visit the north of the country and discover the golden triangle, visit the Taj Mahal and explore the New Delhi. Hampi in Katakanan is also on my buket list.

All in all, my first trip to India was an unforgettable experience, and I cannot wait to go back and explore more of this beautiful and exciting country.
