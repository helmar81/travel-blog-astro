## Great lifestyle

#### I was working for Dropbox in Athens for 7 months


The salary may not be the highest, but you'll be rewarded with excellent food, beautiful beaches, and plenty of sunshine. I recall my holiday in Greece in 1998, it was breathtaking. Back then, the option of easily relocating to Athens and working for top brands like Microsoft, Apple, Audi, and more wasn't readily available. However, times have changed, and now German speakers are highly sought after with numerous job opportunities.

Working overseas can make a significant impact on your resume, as many employers now favor candidates with international experience. In a world that is becoming increasingly globalized, companies are looking for individuals who can effectively communicate and engage with people from diverse backgrounds and cultures. Demonstrating your ability to adapt to new surroundings, such as a new country, language, and customs, showcases your resilience, resourcefulness, and respect for other cultures. Living and working abroad leads to personal and professional growth, even if your job function differs from your current career path. This experience will enhance your interpersonal and soft skills, and demonstrate to potential employers your ability to venture out of your comfort zone, integrate into new work environments, and build new networks. When applying for jobs, it's important to tailor your description of your international work experience to fit the specific position.

Join the world's top brands and benefit from an excellent relocation package.
