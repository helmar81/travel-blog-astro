A land of staggering natural beauty and cultural complexities, of dynamic megacities and hill-tribe villages. Vietnam is both exotic and compelling, it is the land of history stories and spectacular landscapes. Travelling in Vietnam is often associated with highly renowed sites such as Ha Long Bay, Hoi An, and Ho Chi Minh City. However there are stillmany more secrets to discover.

### Sensory overload

Unforgettable experiences are everywhere in Vietnam. There’s the sublime: gazing over a surreal seascape of limestone islands from the deck of a traditional junk in Halong Bay. The ridiculous: taking up to 10 minutes just to cross the street through a tsunami of motorbikes in Saigon. The inspirational: exploring the world’s most spectacular cave systems in Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park. The comical: watching a moped loaded with honking pigs weave a wobbly route along a country lane. And the contemplative: witnessing a solitary grave in a cemetery of thousands of war victims.

### History & Culture

Vietnamese culture is complex, diverse and represents something of a history lesson. The nation’s labyrinthine, teeming trading quarters are rich in indigenous crafts and reflect centuries-old mercantile influences. Ancient temples display distinctly Chinese influences in the north and Hindu origins in the south. Meanwhile the broad, tree-lined boulevards and grand state buildings that grace the capital date from the French colonial period. And it’s impossible to forget Vietnam’s pivotal position close to the epicentre of East Asian power and prosperity, for its cities’ skylines are defined by clusters of glass-and-steel corporate HQs and sleek luxury hotels.

### A culinary superpower


Thailand may contest the top spot, but in Southeast Asia nothing really comes close: Vietnamese food is that good. Incredibly subtle in its flavours and outstanding in its diversity, Vietnamese cooking is a fascinating draw for travellers – myriad street-food tours and cooking schools are testament to this. Geography plays a crucial role, with Chinese flavours influencing the soups of the north, spices sparking up southern cuisine, and herbs and complex techniques typifying the central coastline, rightly renowned as Vietnam’s epicurean hot spot. And up and down the country you can mingle with villagers, sample local dishes and sip rice wine in Vietnam’s many regional markets. On almost every corner you find streetfood or a coffee shop. Vietnam has a high density of small businesses.

### Thrills and chills

If you have the bills, Vietnam has the thrills and chills. Some require a little physical effort, such as motorbiking switchback after switchback up the jaw-dropping Hai Van Pass in central Vietnam. Others require even more sweat: kitesurfing the tropical oceanic waters off Mui Ne or hiking the evergreen hills around Bac Ha or Sapa. And when you’re done with all that adrenaline stuff, there’s plenty of horizontal ‘me’ time to relish. Vietnam has outstanding spas – from marble temples of treatments to simple family-run massage salons with backpacker-friendly rates.

Yeah, I have visited this beautiful country already five times. For the first time in March 2017, just for two weeks and I returned in June and stayed seven weeks.

### Food

The highlight of any trip, Vietnamese food balances sour and sweet flavours, crunchy and silky textures, fried and steamed dishes, soups and salads. Essentially it’s all about the freshness of the ingredients chefs shop twice daily to collect just-picked herbs from the market. Wherever you are, you’ll find exquisite local specialities the ‘white rose’ of Hoi An, banh xeo (savoury filled pancakes) of the south and centre, or the good ol’ pho of the north. Yes, eating out in Vietnam is a feast for the eyes and treat for palate.

### Coffee time

Starbucks may now operate in Vietnam, but indigenous coffee culture runs deep. Virtually every neighbourhood in every town will have a little cafe where locals go to de-stress from the office, the family or simply the traffic. Most are located on quiet side streets with copious greenery to promote relaxation. Vietnamese coffee can be served hot or iced (a real treat in summer), either treacle-thick, or with milk (usually sweetened and condensed) for a double-whammy caffeine-sugar kick. And for something completely different, order a Vietnamese coffee with coconut, yoghurt or even an egg.

### Ho Chi Minh City

Increasingly international but still unmistakably Vietnamese, former Saigon has visceral energy that will delight big-city devotees. HCMC doesn’t inspire neutrality: you’ll either be drawn into its thrilling vortex and hypnotised by the perpetual whir of its orbiting motorbikes, or you’ll find the whole experience overwhelming. Dive in and you’ll be rewarded with a wealth of history, delicious food and a vibrant nightlife that sets the standard for Vietnam. The heat is always on in Saigon; loosen your collar and enjoy.
